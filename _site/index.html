<p><img src="/assets/images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-image" /></p>

<p>My name is Michelle Mobius, and I’m a sophomore MechE at Cornell. I’ve always loved exploring how things work, always trying to figure out the tricks to make technologies better - from robotics, to cars, to planes, to rockets.</p>

<p>I have a fair amount of experience researching and engineering for a broad range of space applications. I’m currently working with the Space Systems Design Lab at Cornell and AVS US on the new ROADS CubeSat. The ROADS CubeSat aims to launch two 3U CubeSats that will autonomously reunite in low Earth orbit. I designed, manufactured, and tested nozzle blocks and propulsion system testing structures using Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks. The experience taught me so much not only about solving concrete engineering problems, and of course CAD, but also about working in teams and developing alongside other engineers. In addition to ROADS, I’m currently working to create an attitude determination system for the space domain awareness simulator we are building.</p>

<p>This past summer, I interned at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics as a Mechanical Engineer. I designed the baffle for MICADO, the Extremely Large Telescope in Chile using NX CAD and Siemens optical model. I also constructed a cryostat shutter for MICADO.</p>

<p>I spent a summer at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in the Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers (CRESST) group. The CRESST experiment is a low mass dark matter search focused on direct dark matter detection using cryostats. I helped design and test tungsten-based transition edge sensors (TES) for the detector using bonding, sputtering, cryostat machines. At the end of the summer I presented a research poster sharing our findings.</p>

<p>I completed a competitive extracurricular program at MIT Lincoln Labs Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI). During the fall and spring semester, I studied satellite development and programming, and learned key design traits for missions involving communication, power generation and usage, size, mass, and performance. During the summer, I worked on a mission to image a representation of Antarctic penguin guano spots using CubeSats.</p>

<p>All of these experiences have prepared me to work hard alongside other engineers in dynamic environments. I know what it takes for a team to work together, creatively problem-solve and find new solutions, and love learning new skills quickly.</p>
