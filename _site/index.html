<p><img src="/assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-image" /></p>

<p>My name is Michelle Mobius, and I’m a sophomore MechE at Cornell. I’ve been incredibly passionate about space exploration for as long as I can remember. 
</p>

<p>Growing up, I moved to a new state almost every year - arriving at our new home, my sister and I would run outside to see who could find the Big Dipper first. I’ve always dreamed of being an aerospace engineer, and contributing to the future of space exploration. Now, as I think of the bold future for engineering, I imagine it will depend on both combining old ideas in new ways and coming up with completely new inventions, facilitated by the collaboration between humans and machines. 
  While working on satellites I’ve mostly focused on applications that have the potential to improve life here on Earth, from providing internet access to remote areas, to measuring greenhouse gas emissions. However, I’ve never let go of my curiosity about the night sky and the unsolved mysteries that lie beyond our planet. My bold idea is to tweak an existing infrastructure, exploring the idea of “buoys in space” - a swarm of small satellites that work together as a large VLBI radio telescope array observing space. Since VLBI resolution increases with size, these buoys can see further in space than existing technology, uncovering solutions for global challenges including resource management and sustainable energy. Building reliable sensors that can operate in space for many years is difficult, but making sure this VLBI constellation can successfully communicate with both itself and a command center on Earth is an even more exciting problem.
  </p>
  <p>Engineering skills like modeling real life systems, designing within constraints, and anticipating failure modes have made me a better problem solver, and a more open-minded thinker. I hope to continue to hone my engineering abilities, communication and leadership skills, and courage to explore new ideas.</p>
