My name is Michelle Mobius and I'm a junior MechE at Cornell with experience in aerospace design and manufacturing.  

This past summer, I interned at Icarus where I designed, manufactured, integrated, and tested hardware for long-endurance solar-powered stratospheric drones. At the Cornell Space Systems Design Studio, I designed a propulsion test structure for a CubeSat and lead development of an attitude determination system for the labâ€™s Space Domain Awareness Simulator. I interned at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, where I designed the baffle for MICADO, the camera for the Extremely Large Telescope in Chile. I also have experience designing and testing tungsten-based transition edge sensors for dark matter detection. At MIT Lincoln Labs Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI), I studied satellite development and programming, and learned key design traits for missions involving communication, power generation and usage, size, mass, and performance. I worked on a mission to image a representation of Antarctic penguin guano spots using CubeSats. 

All of these experiences have prepared me to work hard alongside other engineers in dynamic environments. I know what it takes for a team to work together, creatively problem-solve and find new solutions, and love learning new skills quickly.
