#### Work Experience 

- **Icarus**  
  *Mechanical Engineering Intern*  
  - Designed, manufactured, integrated, and tested hardware for long-endurance solar-powered stratospheric drones. Led rapid prototyping effort for the droneâ€™s avionics bay, and designed/built 20+ parts, including custom mounts for GPS, cameras, telemetry antennas, radio, and flight computer.
  - Co-designed and field-tested a proprietary drone release mechanism, advancing it from proof-of-concept to patent.
  - Conducted system integration and validation through 15+ flight tests and two successful demonstrations with DoD partners.

- **Cornell Space Systems Design Studio**  
  *Undergraduate Researcher*  
  - Develop satellite simulation testbed with hemispherical air bearing to replicate zero gravity and three rotational degrees of freedom for testing GNC, docking, and space domain awareness.
  - Design and implement star tracker for spacecraft attitude, including LED testbed hardware, centroid detection, star catalog referencing, and attitude computation in MATLAB/Python.

- **Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics**  
  *MICADO Mechanical Engineering Intern*  
  - Worked with the MICADO team to design a camera and cryostat shutter for the 40 m Extremely Large Telescope in Chile.
  - Designed the baffle for MICADO using NX and Siemens optical model, focusing on calculating vane apertures and ensuring coefficient of thermal expansion consistency with other camera components in the cryogenic environment. Collaborated with optical and manufacturing engineers for design and implementation.

- **AVS US**  
  *MICADO Mechanical Engineering Intern*  
  - Designed and tested nozzle blocks and a propulsion system testing structure for two ROADS 3U CubeSats, which aim to autonomously reunite in low Earth orbit.

- **Max Planck Institute for Physics**  
  *Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers (CRESST) Intern*  
  - Intern with CRESST experiment â€“ a low mass dark matter search focused on direct dark matter detection using cryogenic detectors.
  - Designed and tested tungsten-based transition edge sensors (TES) using bonding and sputtering machines; presented findings in a research poster.



#### Technical Projects
**MIT Lincoln Labs Beaver Works Engineering**:
 - Built and programmed a model CubeSat that detected climate change via penguin guano; led development of Python code for Bluetooth communication while collaborating on ADCS, image processing, and subsystem integration using Git.

**Cornell MAE 2250 Open Design Project**:
  - Designed, built, and tested a suction-based organizer with a French door mechanism and magnetic latching. Led a team of 6 students through ideation, design, and prototyping. Won Best Presentation award.

#### Achievements & Certifications
