#### Work Experience and Projects
- **[Cornell Space Systems Design Studio ]**:  
  *[Undergraduate Researcher]*  
  - Design and develop star tracker for a satellite simulation testbed by utilizing a hemispherical air bearing to simulate zero gravity, and creating a combination of testbed hardware and lighting
  - Develop the star trackerâ€™s attitude determination using Python and MatLab
  - Designed and tested nozzle blocks and propulsion system testing structure for the ROADS CubeSat which aims to launch two 3U CubeSats that will autonomously reunite in low Earth orbit with AVS US

- **[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics ]**:  
  *[MICADO Mechanical Engineering Intern]*  
  - Intern with the MICADO team, designing a camera and cryostat shutter for the 40 m Extremely Large Telescope in Chile
  - Designed the baffle for MICADO using NX CAD and Siemens optical model, focusing on calculating vane apertures
  - Ensured coefficient of thermal expansion remained consistent with other camera components in the cryogenic environment, and worked with optical and manufacturing engineers for design and implementation

- **[Max Planck Institute for Physics ]**:  
  *[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers (CRESST) Intern]*  
  - Intern with CRESST experiment - a low mass dark matter search focused on direct dark matter detection using cryogenic detectors
  - Helped design and test tungsten-based transition edge sensors (TES) for the detector using bonding, sputtering, cryostat machines
  - Ensured coefficient of thermal expansion remained consistent with other camera components in the cryogenic environment, and worked with optical and manufacturing engineers for design and implementation
  - Wrote and presented a research poster
