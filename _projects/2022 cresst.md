I interned at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in the Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers (<a href="https://cresst-experiment.org/" class="no-underline-link">CRESST</a>) group. The CRESST experiment is a low mass dark matter search focused on direct detection of dark matter using cryogenic detectors. These detectors are crystals equipped with tungsten transition edge sensors (TES), which are ultrasensitive thermal sensors operating in tungsten’s superconductive transition state. Dark matter particles can theoretically be detected by measuring a temperature rise on this sensor due to interactions between dark matter particles and crystal nuclei. CRESST’s cryogenic detectors are unique in that they use tungsten films and calcium tungstate crystals. These tungsten films can be produced with sputtering or evaporation techniques. One of the main challenges in direct dark matter detection is low energy excess which creates false positives: detection of events that are in fact not caused by dark matter interaction. It’s possible these false detections are a result of interference with the detector itself. Different materials used in the production of detectors as well as different techniques of applying these materials could potentially decrease such interference.  I worked primarily on the design, production and testing of the tungsten based TES, and practiced doing literature reviews of past direct dark matter detection experiments, and operating a sputtering machine, bonding machine and cryostat.

**Detector Manufacturing:** To create the TES, I began by cleaning different substrates (CaWO₄, Si, Al₂O₃) with RF or ion source cleaning to get rid of impurities which can contaminate the tungsten film and affect the superconducting transitions. Next we sputtered tungsten onto the substrates to ensure the tungsten is applied indiscriminately to the entire surface. We then used a positive-tone photoresist to shape the tungsten into a desired rectangular configuration and the leftover tungsten was wet-etched. A negative-tone photoresist was used to structure a stripe for a gold thermal link which was deposited by sputtering gold. I then mounted our substrates onto a copper holder and created current connections by bonding aluminum wires to the copper pads. I created a thermal link connection by bonding gold wire to the copper pads, and then mounted our substrate in the cryostat and we cooled the cryostat to mK temperatures to measure the superconducting transition of the TES.
