This summer I interned as a Mechanical Engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial
Physics (MPE), working on MICADO, the camera for the Extremely Large Telescope in Chile. MI1
CADO will take high resolution images of the the Universe at near-infrared wavelengths. MICADO
instruments operate in a cryogenic assembly (82 K) and under vacuum condition. I designed the baffle
for MICADO using NX CAD and Siemens optical model. Key design considerations I had to make
included ensuring the CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) remained consistent with other camera
components and calculating the vane apertures and positions for the baffle in the cold environment and
scaling them up to room temperature. I created technical drawings for my design. I collaborated with
optical and manufacturing engineers to ensure my design fit all constraints and requirements for the
telescope. My design went through multiple iterations and my final baffle design is now being used for
MICADO. I also constructed a cryoshat shutter for MICADO and helped level the MICADO rotator
using a laser tracker. I have lots of experience designing and collaborating with other engineers.
