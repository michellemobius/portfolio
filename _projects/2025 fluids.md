I was on Team Jelly for the fluid mechanics dissection, and we took apart a chainsaw. I contributed to every aspect of the project, from disassembly and learning about how chainsaws work (and their fluid mechancial components) to putting together our slides and recording and editing our video. I worked with my teammates to disassemble the engine and analyze the cylinder block, piston, magneto, and flywheel, along with the fluid mechanical concepts behind each component. I also made the disassembly montage!
