I was on Team Jelly for the fluid mechanics dissection, where we took apart a chainsaw. I contributed to all aspects of the project, from hands-on disassembly/dissection and learning how the chainsaw works (including its fluid-mechanical components) to assembling our slides and recording and editing the final video. I worked closely with my teammates to disassemble the engine and analyze the cylinder block, piston, magneto, carburetor, and flywheel, along with the fluid-mechanical concepts governing each component. I collaborated with Audrey Garon to take piston measurements, calculate the resulting pressure change, and develop the slides, script, and recording for the first three minutes of the video. I also created the disassembly montage. I really enjoyed the dissection project and liked watching my classmates’ videos, as it helped me better understand fluid mechanical applications. It was especially cool to see fluid mechanics show up in technologies I wouldn’t normally expect.
