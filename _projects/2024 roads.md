I’m working on the ROADS CubeSat project in the SSDS lab in collaboration with AVS US. We
aim to launch two 3U CubeSats that will autonomously reunite in Low Earth Orbit. Our expected
launch date is in June on SpaceX’s Falcon 9. I designed, manufactured, and tested a structure for
the propulsion system nozzle blocks in a TVAC using Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks. The stand
is composed of two parts. The first part holds the propulsion system and attaches it to the ATI
F/T Gamma Sensor. The second part attaches the Gamma Sensor to the stand and the stand to the
TVAC. The Gamma sensor is used to record force and torque measurements for the nozzle blocks. I
3D printed the stand using 1.75 mm PLA.
