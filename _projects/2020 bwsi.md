### Beaverworks Summer Institute (BWSI) â€“ MIT Lincoln Laboratory

The Beaverworks Summer Institute (BWSI) is an MIT Lincoln Labs program to work on advanced engineering projects. I took online classes in Python and CubeSat development and in the summer I worked together with a group of highly motivated students from all over the world to build a model CubeSat to detect climate change using penguin guano.

### Motivation and Mission
Since Emperor penguins breed on fast ice (ice that forms and melts quickly), they can serve as powerful climate change indicators. If the satellite detects no guano spots, this means all the fast ice has melted, and that area of the planet has warmed.

We worked in teams to create Bluetooth communication systems, ADCS, image processing code, and integrate it all using Git. The program gave me foundational skills in coding, debugging, and integrating and building different CubeSat subsystems.

Learning firsthand about real-life space missions and all the different factors that go into creating and launching a satellite really catalyzed my love for space, and it was humbling to see how such a small object could be so powerful in collecting data from space.
