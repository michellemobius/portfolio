The Beaverworks Summer Institute (BWSI) is an MIT Lincoln Labs program to work on advanced engineering projects. I took online classes in Python and CubeSat development and in the summer I worked together with a group of highly motivated students from all over the world to build and program a model CubeSat to detect climate change using penguin guano. Since Emperor penguins breed on fast ice (ice that forms and melts quickly), they can serve as powerful climate change indicators. If the satellite detects no guano spots, this means all the fast ice has melted, and that area of the planet has warmed. We worked in teams to create Bluetooth communication systems, ADCS, image processing code, and integrate it all using Git. I led the bluetooth integration subteam.
