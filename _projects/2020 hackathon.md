### MIT Blueprint Hackathon

I led a team of 4 for MIT’s Blueprint Hackathon. We coded a website that allows anyone to design a virtual postcard from NASA’s “astronomy picture of the day,” which has been published daily since 1995. Users can specify a recipient of the card, a custom greeting, and a specific date associated with the occasion. It’s an exciting way to connect with family and friends, while also making astronomy knowledge easily accessible in people’s day-to-day lives. My little brother was our early adopter. After seeing him use our website to create a postcard for his best friend’s birthday, I decided to keep the site online.

When I previously participated in science and robotics competitions, my projects usually disappeared in our basement to collect dust. I told my friends and teachers about our website, and a year later, when looking at the server logs, I discovered that the site is used almost every day by someone.

The people at NASA who made the “picture of the day” website did not know that teams like ours would build on their creation almost thirty years later. When we coded our virtual postcard website, we used almost a dozen JavaScript and NodeJS open-source libraries, each of them made freely available by some altruistic programmers. While these building blocks might seem small and insignificant, they are put together every day to create something new, beautiful, and unexpected.
