I led a team of 4 to win 2nd place in MIT’s Blueprint Hackathon. We coded a website that allows anyone to design a virtual postcard from NASA’s “astronomy picture of the day,” which has been published daily since 1995. Users can specify a recipient of the card, a custom greeting, and a specific date associated with the occasion. It’s an exciting way to connect with family and friends, while also making astronomy knowledge easily accessible in people’s day-to-day lives. When looking at the server logs, I discovered that the site is used almost every day by someone.

Check out our website and send a postcard
