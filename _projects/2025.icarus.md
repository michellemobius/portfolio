 <a href="https://www.icarus.one/" class="no-underline-link"> Icarus's </a> mission is to re-establish and maintain dominance in the stratosphere. I designed, manufactured, integrated, and tested hardware for long-endurance solar-powered stratospheric drones. 

**Objectives and Scope:** Our main design goals were to ensure reliability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of manufacturability to enable rapid prototyping. Key considerations included center of gravity, thermal performance, and mass optimization.

**Projects:** I primarily worked on the mechanical design and testing for Icarus's avionics and deployment systems. For the avionics, I designed over 20+ mounts that supported the flight computer, radio, telemetry antennas, GPS, and payload avionics. I built and manufactured five different iterations of the drone to support different flight test objectives. For the deployment system, I co-designed a proprietary glider release mechanism, advancing it from proof of concept to a patent. This release mechanism enables effective deployment of drones from high-altitude balloons at target altitudes. I conducted system integration and validation through 15+ flight tests and two successful demonstrations with DoD partners.
