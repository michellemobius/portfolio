### Introduction
Icarus's mission is to re-establish and maintain dominance in the stratosphere. I designed, manufactured, integrated, and tested hardware for long-endurance solar-powered stratospheric drones. 

#### Objective and Scope
Our main design goals are to ensure our products are reliable, cost-effective, and easily manufacturable for rapid prototyping. Key considerations include center of gravity, thermal performance, and mass optimization.
